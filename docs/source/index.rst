.. CLASSIX documentation

Welcome to CLASSIX's documentation!
===================================

Clustering is the problem of partitioning data into numerous groups based on the data properties without labels needed. It is a widely-used unsupervised learning technique to find underlying patterns and structures in data, which has a broad of applications in time series analysis, social network analysis, market segmentation, anomaly detection, and image segmentation. 
CLASSIX is an explainable sorting-based clustering algorithm towards fast and scalable applications. In this documentation, we will illustrate the setting of CLASSIX and introduce some basic clustering applications.
